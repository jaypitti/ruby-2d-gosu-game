# SIMPLE 2D GAME

Hello!

This is my simple 2D game, it is just a side project I have been working on and
I am open to any feedback!
## How to play

use WASD to move your character and the Arrow Keys to attack in each corresponding direction.
E and Q open and clsoe inventory.

## Prerequisites

There are a couple things you need to run it.

You will need to have the [Gosu gem installed](https://rubygems.org/gems/gosu/versions/0.10.8).

### Multiplayer Option

If you are wanting to test the online multiplayer you will need to install
the [Celluloid gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/celluloid/versions/0.17.3).

### Start the game

1. The repo now includes a .app for macOS users to run it without needing to download ruby. (Windows will be coming soon)

2. From the project's root directory run the following to start the game:
