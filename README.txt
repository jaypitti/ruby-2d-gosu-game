Hello!

This is my simple 2D game, it is just a side project I have been working on and
I am open to any feedback!

There are a couple things you need to run it.

You will need to have the Gosu gem installed.

and if you are wanting to test the online multiplayer you will need to install
the Celluloid gem.

to start the game navigate to the folder which you cloned this from in your
Terminal and use "ruby Game.rb `User Name`"

to start the server and game navigate to the folder which you cloned this from
in your Terminal, open 2 tabs and use "ruby GameServer.rb" then use "ruby Game.rb `User` `IP` `Port`"
